// .Pid is a plain int and syscall.Kill bypasses os.Process.Signal, which is
// where the done flag set by Wait is checked. Once the child is reaped the
// kernel may reissue that PGID, and the signal lands on whatever holds it now.

// Setting it as cmd.Cancel is safe by construction — os/exec invokes Cancel
// before reaping. Calling it directly is best-effort: the caller must skip it
// once the child is reaped, which narrows the reuse window but cannot close it
// (the reap and the check cannot be made atomic). See BashTask.Stop and
