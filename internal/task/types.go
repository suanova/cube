// BackgroundTask is the common interface for all background task types

// An implementation owes one thing the compiler cannot check: a Stop-induced
// exit must stay distinguishable from a failure, so that a task the user
// called off is not reported as broken work to retry. How is left open,
// because the two existing types genuinely differ — a bash child reports its
// graceful SIGTERM, while an agent goroutine returns context.Canceled.

	// Stop asks the task to exit on its own and returns without waiting for

	// Manager.Kill waits gracefulStopTimeout and then calls Kill, so a Stop
	// must not enforce a deadline of its own.
	//
	// An implementation must not let its own hard-kill path pre-empt the
	// graceful attempt it is making here — a Stop that trips the very
	// mechanism that kills the task outright has not stopped it gracefully at
	// all, it has just taken a longer route to Kill.
