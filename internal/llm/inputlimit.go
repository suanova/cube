// The context window is the denominator of every "how full is the context"
// question Cube asks — the status bar's percentage and the agent's
// auto-compaction trigger. Both must get the same answer, so both resolve it
// here. Issue #338 was the display and the trigger disagreeing; keeping one
// resolver is what stops that from recurring.

// InputLimitEnvVar sets the window for a model Cube cannot size on its own,
// e.g. an aggregator serving a model without publishing its limits. There is
// deliberately no default to stand in for it: a guessed window is acted on
// silently, and guessing low costs real context on every compaction while
// guessing high never fires at all. An unknown window resolves to 0, which
// skips proactive compaction and leaves the prompt-too-long retry
// (isPromptTooLong) to recover — one wasted request, no invented number, and
// the status bar honestly reads "--" instead of a percentage of a guess.
//
// legacyInputLimitEnvVar is the pre-fork name; it is still read when the
// canonical name is unset so existing san setups keep working.
